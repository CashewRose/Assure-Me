# Welcome To Assure Me!

## What is Assure me?

Assure Me is an app that helps people with their depression. Reports show that daily affirmations help people with their confidence and self-esteem. Sometimes people just need a little bit of validation. Users are able to insert a few things they like about themselves or perhaps something positive others have told them. Once a day they will recieve a text message to turn their thinking around with a personal affirmation of themselves.
